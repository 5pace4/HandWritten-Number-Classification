## 1 Introduction

In the realm of machine learning, the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification to number 
prediction project stands as a pursuit aimed at crafting a proficient model capable of accurately 
identifying and classifying handwritten digits as well as numbers. At its core, this project aims at 
harnessing the potential of the MNIST dataset â€“ a well-regarded repository of 28x28 pixel 
grayscale images featuring handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9 where the training and testing 
size is of 60, 000 and 10, 000 respectively. The central objective is to implement a robust 
classification algorithm, one that possesses the ability to automatically discern and categorize 
distinct digits based on the nuanced pixel values within each image. That means, this project is all 
about teaching a computer to be smart with handwritten numbers. Our job is to train the computer 
to look at the pictures and say, "Oh, that's a 3!" or "Hey, that's a 7!" We're basically making the 
computer learn how to recognize and tell apart different numbers by looking at tiny dots that make 
up the pictures. It's like teaching the computer its own special way of reading our handwritten 
numbers.
